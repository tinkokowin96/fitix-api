# Gym Management System

The Gym Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline the operations of fitness facilities, providing gym owners, staff, trainers, and members with a robust platform for effective management, engagement, and fitness tracking.

## Tech Stack

### Backend

- **NestJS:**

  - A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications. It leverages TypeScript and follows a modular architecture.

- **Microservices Architecture:**

  - The application is built on a microservices architecture, enabling independent development, deployment, and scaling of various modules.

- **RabbitMQ:**

  - A message broker that facilitates communication between microservices through a robust and scalable message queuing protocol.

- **gRPC:**

  - A high-performance RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework that facilitates communication between microservices, providing efficient and fast data exchange.

- **Redis:**
  - In-memory data store used for caching, session management, and enhancing performance in distributed systems.

### Design Patterns

- **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete):**

  - Employed for modules where operations are straightforward and traditional CRUD operations are sufficient.

- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):**
  - Implemented in modules with complex business logic, diverse querying needs, and where scalability and independent scaling of read and write components are crucial.
